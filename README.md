Hi All, my name is Cristian, I'm a CS student at Uni of Manchester, currently on my placement at Bloomberg in London.

My public github is filled with projects that are pretty old at this point and have their roots way before I knew about code quality and other modern luxuries. During Uni, specially during my 2nd year, I was either working part-time / spending too much time perfecting coursework so in terms of other projects that area is pretty lacking.
